Uploaded here are all appendices and data related to PYM0EP dissertation titled
	Eye want to be sure: establishing the role of intolerance
	of uncertainty in eye-tracking conditioning paradigms
		by Claudia Rodriguez-Sobstel.

These include data cleaning and analysis scripts (Appendices F and I respectively).
Data entered into Data Cleaning script are within the 'data' folder.
Cleaned data utilised in the Data Analysis script are within the 'data/cleaned' folder. 
The file titled 'dataframe_2.csv' was utilised for analyses (exclusion of n = 5).

It is recommended to use the .rmd or .html versions of R scripts wherever possible.

Please also note that SPSS outputs included fixation duration data pre log-transformation. 
These outputs are therefore not entirely correct, however, were included as I 
cross-checked results from the other eye-tracking measures to ensure my R scripts 
were correct.
